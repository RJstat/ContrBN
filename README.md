ContrBN: Controllability Analysis Software Package for Boolean Networks

In order to develop a wider determination way for more users, a user friendly toolbox named
’ContrBN’ has been proposed. For any Boolean networks with arbitrary number of nodes and
Boolean functions, users are only required to provide the logic expressions of dynamic network, the
controllability can be determined efficiently.
